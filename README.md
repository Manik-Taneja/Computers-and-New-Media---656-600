ABSTRACT 
Text, audio, and video are the three main modalities of video data. The current video summarization employs summarizing videos based on frame importance. While the nature of the solution gives results the algorithms do not utilize the essence of text and audio in the video. It is observed that the ranking, text, audio, and semantics of video frames are essential for video summary evaluation. To portray the accurate summarization of a video we propose to approach the problem in a threefold manner, thus we divide the problem statement into three parts: Subtitles in the selected YouTube video is the first part. Secondly, the audio of the file is taken into consideration. As the third part of the problem, we concentrate on the frames, especially images, in the video. In this project we aim to create a video summary that is dense and make it better than the older or existing ones by including richer information.


PROPOSED SOLUTION
To meet the demands of massive video data, video summarization has been developed. The main goal of video summarization is the identification of pertinent and significant information.The flow of the project would be to download a youtube video, extract the SRT file for the same, and apply extractive summarization (different algorithms to test which one is better), based on the sentences and their referenced timestamps from the SRT file we will have a shortened version of the video. To set our project apart from any of the normal ideas we will also implement audio analysis that will include finding crests and troughs in the .wav file of the youtube video in order to find the points of high amplitude. Based on these two analysis we will provide custom weights to each analysis and output a summarized video that will be shorter and will contain maximum valuable information.
From a software standpoint we look forward to providing an optimized approach towards summarizing a youtube video while promoting the underlying Computers and New Media concepts such as clear narrative, ease of access and advantageous to its users.
